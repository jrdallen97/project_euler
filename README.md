# Project Euler solutions

Just me attempting to solve problems from https://projecteuler.net using various languages.

## Running stuff

Most stuff should just work w/ their shebangs.

### Rust

Ensure that the problem is listed in `Cargo.toml` and run with e.g. `cargo run --bin p001`.

Alternatively, install [rust-script](https://rust-script.org/) and run with e.g. `rust-script p001/main.rs`.
